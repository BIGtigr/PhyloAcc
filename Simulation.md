[R/Simulation.R](https://github.com/xyz111131/PhyloAcc/blob/master/R/Simulation.R) generated the simulated sequences for ratite phylogeny for different accelerated scenarios. The resulting files are in *Simulation_ratite/simu_500_200_diffr_** *. Fasta is concatenated alignment file for all simulated elements under each scenario; Bed is the coordiate file.
1-1 is for "all branches conserved"; 2-* is for 1) only kiwi clade accelerated; 2) only emu/cassowary branches accelerated; 3) only rheas clade accelerated; 4) only ostrich accelerated; 5) all ratites accelerated except ostrich and moa; 6) all ratites accelerated; 7) both ratites and volant tinamous accelerated; 8) 5 random species across all birds accelerated.

we fixed gBGC only affecting emu and cassowary branches (and their common ancestor) in ratites as well as finch, flycatcher and swift in Neognatha clade, and altered selection patterns: 1) all branches are conserved; 2) only kiwi clade accelerated; 3) only emu/cassowary branches accelerated; 4) only rheas clade accelerated; 5) only ostrich accelerated; 6) all ratites accelerated except ostrich and moa; 7) all ratites accelerated.
